The Tale of $hero$
or, The Scribe of $home$

A long time ago, in $home.country$, there was a young boy of $home$ called $hero.fullname$. He had a penpal called $darling.fullname$, and they would write to each other whenever they could.
One day, $darling$'s step-father, the villainous $nemesis.fullname$, read one of $hero$'s letters, and was outraged by what he saw. He sent $darling$ away to a convent, and whipped $hero$ to within an inch of his life.

$hero$ decided he must find $darling$, and packed his things, said his goodbyes, and left $home$, possibly forever.
