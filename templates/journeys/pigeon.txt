type journey

One day, while $hero$ was looking wistfully out of a window, a pigeon landed next to him with a great air of pomp and Purpose. It then began to peck at its leg.

There was a note attached to it! $hero$ bashed the pigeon on the head and removed the note.

Pausing just a moment to reflect on whether that really was how homing pigeons worked, $hero$ thanked his lucky stars and started packing his things.

$darling$ was alive, and in $curlo$!
