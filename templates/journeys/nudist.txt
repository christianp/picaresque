On the way $hero$ met a kindly nudist.

"I can see your lady parts!" he exclaimed, on seeing her lady parts.
"Yes, that's the idea. I'm a nudist, you see," said the nudist.
"Oh right. I don't suppose you know where $curlo$ is, do you?" he asked, trying to look at something other than the nudist's wobbly hooha.
"Maybe I do," she replied, "I've got a map of $curlo.country$ tattooed on my back, would you like to take a look?"

$hero$ weighed up the pros and cons of the nudist's offer for a while.
"Alright," he said," but no funny business."

Having memorised the route, $hero$ thanked the nudist and set off on his way, and a few short years later arrived in $curlo$.
