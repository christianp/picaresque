$hero$ stood on the dock, trying to look like he fitted in.

A sailor approached him, tutting theatrically.

"Darling, that stripey shirt is SO outmode! A crew just arrived yesterday from a trip round the world, half of them were dying from scurvy, the other half had been turned into swine by a sexy witch, and they ALL looked better than you. Let Hugo help."

"I don't suppose the hat helps at all, does it?"

"No, dear."
